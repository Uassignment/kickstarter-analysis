Data analysis on Kickstarter fundraising effort
## Overview of Project

Project has three deliverables, technical analysis incorporating data visualization techniques for Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. The project also provides written analysis of the results. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help Louise understand how different Kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
The project will perform analysis, focusing on campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

We have datasets from multiple years. The analysis in this project covers from 2009-2017. However, individual years might have completely different outcomes.
The economic outlook, unemployment level, inflation, and any other elements that may have affected the fundraising effort have not been considered.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The month of May and June have more favorable outcomes for overall success, both in terms of the number of fundraisings started and the number of successful outcomes than the rest of the year.
On the other hand, December seems to be the worst month both in terms of launching and successfully funding campaign goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Fundraisings with goals that are less than $1,000.00 have a much higher rate of success. 
This same category is also having the highest projects numbers associated with it.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This dataset has many cases of outliers. The analyst must pay great attention and address each question under scrutiny to avoid misconceptions. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1.	Summer seems to be a good season to launch a new fundraising project for more favorable outcome 
2.	Music category outcomes seems to be consistent throughout the year. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Goals that are less than one thousand dollars have a significantly higher percentage of success than the category of higher goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There seems to be a lot of outliers. Some of the categories do have enough data sample to create a strong predictive model. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can compare the dataset count and their success rate across the countries. Example of pivot table.
